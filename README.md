# Offline-Traffic-Sign-Recognition-On-Mobile-Device
Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree, Capstone Project


This project focuses on using deep learning to enable traffic sign recognition without internet connectivity on a mobile device.

### Requirements
The following libraries are required to run the notebooks (Python 3.5)
- Tensorflow
- Keras
- OpenCV
- Numpy
- sklearn
- Matplotlib
- PIL
- Pandas
- Pickle

### Dataset
The dataset can be obtained from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rRXU4GuCPqFMusQh2rWJH8aqldIiwTmO).
  - Extract the zip file into the root folder, i.e the GTSRB folder should be in the same directory as the notebooks.
 
### Setting up android project 
The android project requires the OpenCV-android-sdk to be present in the same directory that contains the project folder. The OpenCV-android-sdk can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=13ZKOrU1L4grOcNsIw4ijaTPIg4pJrNYD)

### APK 
If there is a problem building the project and you just want to use the APK, it can be obtained from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_SysWy7CUhLyi5U7WAD-xVLOm0GlawU2)
